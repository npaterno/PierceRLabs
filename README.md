BEFORE our first lab day, you will need to download and install R and RStudio. Links are below. If you have a Chromebook please let me know asap as you will be unable to download these.

R - Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/

Mac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

Linux: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

RStudio - https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

For RStudio, select the "Desktop Free" version. The website will detect your operating system and provide the correct download link.
